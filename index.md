# Mixtape and typesmith

I've started an open-source project called [Mixtape](http://www.github.com/bbor/mixtape). It's essentially a static site generation tool for documentation content, especially useful when you have some kind of typed hierarchical data. For example, you could use it for an API, or a set of visual programming nodes. You feed Mixtape with your data objects, each of which typically has some content in HTML or Markdown, and it generates for you a help system with autocomplete search, TOC, full-text search, etc.

Accompanying this project is [typesmith](http://www.github.com/bbor/typesmith): a data processing pipeline (inspired by [Metalsmith](http://www.github.com/bbor/mixtape)!) that helps you pre-process your data records into the form expected by Mixtape.

Here's a **very early** [sample of some mixtape output](./mixtape/demo-nodejs/misc_About_this_Documentation.html), generated from the nodejs.org documentation using the pipeline you can find in the [typesmith-testing](http://www.github.com/bbor/typesmith-testing) repo.

# Stingray hands-on training mission

These in-product tutorials were designed to accompany a new user through the main steps of creating games and interactive projects in Stingray.

I designed the content, wrote the UI text, and programmed the JavaScript framework on top of an open-source module and our editor's plug-in system.

	$("a#training_images").click(
		function() {

# Stingray SDK Help

Customers use the SDK to write plugins that extend the Stingray environment to work with custom kinds of content and third-party software.
Writing these docs required detailed knowledge of how Stingray works internally, and coding skills in multiple languages (C/C++, JavaScript, Lua).
Analysis, synthesis, and recapitulation.

# Stingray Lua, visual programming, and C API reference docs

I programmed a doc build system that turns code comments into HTML. The overall styling was constrained to be consistent with our existing API reference docs generated by doxygen, but I was able to add some nice extras like the typeahead search and expandable sections.

The C plugin reference is extra-specially original though: a browsable and searchable rendering of the header files. Tooltips on the elements show docs, and offer navigation between definitions and usage examples.
