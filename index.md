# Stingray hands-on training mission

These in-product tutorials are designed to accompany a new user through all the main steps of creating content in Stingray.

I designed the content, wrote the UI text, and programmed the JavaScript framework on top of an open-source module and our editor's plug-in system.

<a id="training_images" href="javascript:;"><img src="/images/training_thumbnail.png"></a>
<script>
$(document).ready( function () {
	$("a#training_images").click(
		function() {
			$.fancybox.open([
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0003.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0004.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0005.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0006.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0007.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0008.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0009.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0009a.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0009b.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0010.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0011.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0013.png'},

				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0016.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0017.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0018.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0019.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0020.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0021.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0022.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0023.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0024.png'}
				]
			);
		});
	});

# Stingray SDK Help

Customers use the SDK to write plugins that extend the Stingray environment to work with custom kinds of content and third-party software.
Writing these docs required detailed knowledge of how Stingray works internally, and coding skills in multiple languages (C/C++, JavaScript, Lua).

# Stingray Lua, visual programming, and C API reference docs

I programmed a doc build system that turns code comments into HTML. The overall styling was intended to be consistent with our existing API reference docs generated by doxygen, but I was able to add some nice extras like the typeahead search and expandable sections.

The C plugin reference is extra-special: a browsable and searchable rendering of the header files. Tooltips on the elements show docs, and offer navigation between definitions and usage examples.
