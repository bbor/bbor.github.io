# Stingray hands-on training mission

These in-product tutorials were designed to accompany a new user through the main steps of creating games and interactive projects in Stingray.

I designed the content, wrote the UI text, and programmed the JavaScript framework on top of an open-source module and our editor's plug-in system.

<a id="training_images" href="javascript:;" title="view the gallery"><img src="/images/stingray_training_thumbnail.png"></a>
<script>
$(document).ready( function () {
	$("a#training_images").click(
		function() {
			$.fancybox.open([
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0003.png'},
				{src:'/images/stingray_training_0004.png'},

# Stingray SDK Help

Customers use the SDK to write plugins that extend the Stingray environment to work with custom kinds of content and third-party software.
Writing these docs required detailed knowledge of how Stingray works internally, and coding skills in multiple languages (C/C++, JavaScript, Lua).
Analysis, synthesis, and recapitulation.

# Stingray Lua, visual programming, and C API reference docs

I programmed a doc build system that turns code comments into HTML. The overall styling was constrained to be consistent with our existing API reference docs generated by doxygen, but I was able to add some nice extras like the typeahead search and expandable sections.

The C plugin reference is extra-specially original though: a browsable and searchable rendering of the header files. Tooltips on the elements show docs, and offer navigation between definitions and usage examples.
